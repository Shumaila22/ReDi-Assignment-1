<!-- BOILER PLATE CODE
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<!-- 
1. Your code is missing <!DOCTYPE html> which is an error.
    <!DOCTYPE html> is essential as it tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.
    Typing "!" in a blank HTML file and pressing Enter (or Tab) generates this boilerplate automatically.     
2.  In html tag, lang attribute is missing
    Setting lang="en" helps browsers, screen readers, and search engines recognize that the content is in English. For other languages, you would adjust the code (e.g., lang="fr" for French).

    Consider using semantic HTML elements instead of <div> tags to improve accessibility and readability.
    For example, use <main> for main content, <section> for grouped content, and <nav> for button containers.
